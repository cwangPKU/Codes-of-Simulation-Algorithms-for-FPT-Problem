# Codes-of-Simulation-Algorithms-for-FPT-Problem

This repository includes all the related codes to reproduce the numeric experiments in my undergraduate thesis "Analytical Solutions and Efficient Simulation Algorithms for the First Passage Time Distribution in Stochastic Processes"

Warm thanks to Ruirong Feng for attending the coding works of realizing "Hybric Scheme" and "Markov Approximation" algorithms for simulating Rough Heston model.
